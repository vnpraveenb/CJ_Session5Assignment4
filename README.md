# CJ_Session5Assignment4

Create an interface Stack in package myPack with following methods
Methods:
• void push(int I)
• int pop()
Create two subclasses inheriting the Stack interface.
class FixedStack that can accept a fixed numbers of integers. The size of the Stack will be specified in the constructor.
If the number of integers exceeds the size, “Stack overflow” message should be displayed.
 
class VariableStack that can accept numbers more than its size. The size of the Stack will be specified in the constructor. 
If the number of integers exceeds the size, the stack should automatically grow to accommodate the new element.

Expected Output
Make a program that checks the implementation of both the classes.
